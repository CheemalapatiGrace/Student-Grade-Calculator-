Student Grade Calculator (Java OOP Project)
The Student Grade Calculator is a simple, efficient, and beginner-friendly Java project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project allows users to enter student details, calculate grades automatically based on marks, and store the results in a text file for future reference. It is a perfect example of using Java fundamentals such as classes, objects, ArrayLists, conditionals, and file handling in a well-structured manner.

Project Overview
This CLI-based application collects a student’s name and marks, computes the grade based on predefined criteria, and displays the results. It also writes all results to a file named grades.txt, making the project useful for learning basic file input/output operations in Java. The code is kept simple and readable, making it suitable for students preparing for placements, university assignments, or strengthening their core programming concepts.
